8) The difference is that carving requires navMesh to be recomputed.  You want the carve checkbox to be active if the obstacle is going to be static for a long period of time.  You want it to be deactivated of the object is going to be moving.  
	i) The navMeshAgent is going to be constantly recalculating which is costly
	ii) Then, the agents will have the potential to get hung up on every single obstacle

9) An agent can predict the movement of an obstacle and accelerate/decelerate in order to avoid it.
